            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Massimo Vignelli's Signed 2012 NYC Subway Diagram</h1><p>Less than one year ago, the world lost one of its most important creative minds with the passing of Massimo Vignelli. The celebrated graphic designer bestowed upon us a great number of now-iconic designs, though perhaps none more visibly lasting than his 1972 MTA New York City Transit subway map.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8f32d0a35a78621feb4c771f37440467815b250e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

But the Design Museum Gent isn't interested in the past; between 25 March - 23 October it showcases a collection of contemporary models from the new millennium, including Philippe Starck's electric bike 'MASS' or Tobias Knockaert's laser-cut bicycle, and prototypes and experiments for the future, with unusual aesthetics, materials and functions.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e75dd9b06e93c20d73aed8ffe8845b13b5208794.jpg"></article>]]></description>

This is simply because most of us have one WiFi router for our entire home, and that just doesn't work for how we use Internet today.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e75956575966b1c70c11ff614cb972cd2133a6a9.jpg"></article>]]></description>
